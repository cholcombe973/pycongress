pycongress
==========

Open source government. <br>
A python script that enables people to be a part of the legislative process. <br>
The idea is that twitter is leveraged to approve or deny new laws.<br> 
Python will parse the Info on govtrack.us and put it up for vote on twitter. @replies with approve/deny are counted . Everyone knows that politicians never do what we want. why not replace them with a more social voting process?<br>
